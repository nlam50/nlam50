PREDICTIONS:
* If you go to the webpage, a login page will appear where you can enter a username and press submit
* Once you press submit, the web server will route you to the http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth page, triggering the authenticate() method
* As a result, the web server will display "Waaaa hooo HAAAH"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCO:
* When you run app.py, print statement from testmod0.py appears in the terminal and the webpage displays “Howdy, friends!” along with an input box and submission button.
* After you enter a username in the input box, terminal displays auth?username=<username>&sub1=Submit between “GET / and HTTP/1.1" 200 -
* After you submit a username, the web server goes to http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=<username>&sub1=Submit 

After uncommenting...
* disp_loginpage() will produce a BadRequestKeyError when print(request.args[‘username’] is run– does it need information after submitting the query? 
* In the terminal, information is displayed about the object (Flask obj, request obj, request.args, request.args[‘username’], request.headers)
* There is only an error when disp_loginpage() requests the username, not when authenticate() requests, because at the time when disp_loginpage() is run, the username has not been entered yet
* request.args is an ImmutableMultiDict with the variables from the form and their values
* request.args['username'] in authenticate() is the username that was submitted
* request.headers contains a lot of backend information, like the host, user agent, etc.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q/C/C:
* What are the methods (methods=[‘GET’, ‘POST’])? 
There are syntax errors when this part is uncommented
* What are all the possible input types when creating a form in HTML?
* Does Flask automatically create the modified URL when the form is submitted?
* What is the purpose of the test module?
