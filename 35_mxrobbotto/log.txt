DISCO:
- be wary of additional packages that it tries to suggest
- if you ask it to generate a text file of the conversation, it will do so and you will be able to download the text file
- you are able to open and move between files of the project that it generates (they are also all downloadable)
- when asked not to do something, it tended to ignore the direction and simply proceed with what it was originally doing
- providing the requirements.txt file and the import lines of the python files allowed us to achieve the desired outcome (to not use unverified modules)
- in general, more specificity and exact words lead to better outcomes
- it cannot directly create or upload images
- when asked to create an image (jpg) it provided us with a python script to generate an image (using the Pillow library)

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?
