DISCO:
* we could have used inline styling to supplement the fef html/css
* be careful what you link
* #s in ref links allow you to link to "sections" of your page
* Foundation setup, make sure to include:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites/dist/css/foundation.min.css">
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites/dist/js/foundation.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(document).foundation();
  </script>
* foundation had prebuilt templates available for download
* for foundation, we didn't notice another script statement at the bottom of the file,
  that caused a lot of headache and unpleasantries
* Tailwind setup, make sure to include:
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
* Tailwind allows you to customize the cursor icon when hovering over a certain element
  <p class="cursor-auto">
  (auto, pointer, wait, move, not-allowed)
* Tailwind is mostly CSS
* Tailwind has mobile customization options

Q1:
I think I prefer bootstrap, I can't define it exactly, but it seems a lot more intuitive and easier to work with. The other frameworks, though good, seemed a bit more finicky. Maybe this is a preference that will change with time as I work with one or the other, but as of right now, I just generally prefer bootstrap.

I think I prefer bootstrap. I feel like it's easier to get into than foundations or tailwind, and I feel like I was able to find more features to play around with. In Tailwind's case it's just CSS, so there aren't as many options. I think I could explore all of them more, since it feels like bootstrap is the most established, but I guess that's part of the reason why I prefer it?
