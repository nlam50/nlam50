NOTES:
* GET requests can be seen in the URL (appended after ".../auth"), while POST requests cannot (but they are still not secure)
* request.args has the variables from GET requests, request.form has the variables from POST requests (and is also an immutable dictionary)
* GET is the default method in the HTML template, but you can specify using POST by adding method="POST" to the line that begins the form
* You don't need to specify methods=['GET'] in the app route, but you do need to include methods=['POST'] if you're using a POST request
